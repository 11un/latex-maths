\section*{Normal Distribution Intuition}
\paragraph{Definition:}%

In probability theory, the normal (or Gaussian or Gauss or Laplaceâ€“Gauss) distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution. Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution}{Wikipedia}

\paragraph{Probability Density Function:}
\begin{equation}
	\mH{%
		p(x) = \frac{1}{a\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp
		\left(-\frac{\negBi{x}{\mu}}{2\sigma^2}\right)
	}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Cumulative Function:}
\begin{equation}
	\mH{%
		p(x) = \frac{1}{a\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp
		\left(-\frac{\negBi{x}{\mu}}{2\sigma^2}\right)
	}
\end{equation}
